When our group came together we were all extremely shy. It took a while to break
the ice, but now I feel like people are a lot more comfortable contributing
ideas to the group. To help solidify the group I kept the energy positive. While
we were struggling last week I would laugh at it instead of being negative. Something that
I did to cause friction was probably being too direct when things aren't working. 
Being too direct can hurt peoples egos, and cause friction in the group. To create group cohesiveness
I've spent time getting to know everyone better. With us all being pretty shy it means we have
to feel comfortable to voice our opinions.
